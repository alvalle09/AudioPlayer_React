# AudioPlayer using React with Typescript

## Agenda
- create a music player app
- integrate React with the Audio API
- hook up the Audio API to a user's speaker system
- play a track
- control the playback and volume

## How to use Audio API

1. First, we create an AudioContext. This controls audio data and routes it where it's required.
2. Create a source e.g a stream from an mp3 file.
3. Create effect Nodes
4. Provide a destination for the audio e.g. the computer's speakers.
5. Connect sources to the effects, and effects to the destination.
